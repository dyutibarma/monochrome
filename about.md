# Hi, I'm Nicolas
Currently, I’m a lead designer and mentor for the suite of e-commerce sites under the URBN umbrella. I specialize in personalization, listing, and the users journey from inspiration to purchase. During my time with URBN, I designed and launched the companies first fully responsive website, WithoutWalls — it is currently a defunct business, but we still use a lot of the design principles that I laid a foundation for.

If you’re interested in heuristics, see my post on the heuristic evaluation tool I put together while I entered with Think Company — We’ve been using it at URBN to qualify our experiences. Additionally, I’ve presented a light weight intro to heuristic eval’s to students at Temple Universitys Management Information Science program’s User Experience Course.
