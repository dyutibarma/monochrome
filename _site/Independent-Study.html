		<p>I wrote the following article when I was 18 – I was empowered with the opportunity by my parents to go on a 14 day trip in the Sierra Nevada Mountain range through an Outward Bound program. Going on this trip, I decided to retain a daily journal; it it I cataloed the relationsips manifesting between myself and the rest of the group. Transposing this against Maslows Hierarchy of needs, I comprised the following distillation.</p>

<p>Guidance was provided by a highschool Psychology teacher. 
<!--more--></p>

<h3 id="day-by-day-outward-bound-course">Day by Day Outward Bound Course</h3>

<p>At first, no one bonded. We were all loners. Our two instructors were very open and easy to talk to, but that is how they are supposed to be.</p>

<p>It took a few days for people to begin to connect. Day 2 was what I consider a learning day. We were learning each other’s names, and what kind of people we were. There was a little conversation, the same questions over and over, “Where do you live?”, “How old are you?” , “What year are you in school?”. Just to begin to know each other. After a couple of hours, there was more to the conversations than that. Although, it still was very simple.</p>

<p>Day three we became comfortable with each other, we all knew most people’s names, and had substantial conversations. Relationships began to flourish, and conversations erupted. We were in the learning stage of the course and were forced to work closely together. Being on a strenuous course gave us all something to relate. Day three was what I consider the day that most relationships started, only a few were to come.</p>

<p>On day four we went to a difficult climbing area. This forced the group to cooperate and trust each other. Three full days into the course, we had little trust in each other. For some this might have been difficult, but it did not affect me, I did not think twice. During this activity, Justin began to talk, and become friendlier. Most of the group was tight, there were only a few people that kept their distance, or did not fit in as well. Although Daryl seemed quiet and to himself, you could tell that he was just waiting to come out. He would talk a little here and there, but not a substantial amount.</p>

<p>Day five was our first peak climb, which was also the largest bonding experience the whole trip. Not only did it mean that we were at the top of the world, 9,000 feet, high, but we accomplished an amazing feat as a team. We did something extremely difficult together. At the very top, the highest point, we opened our high low pack, which kept us at our highest of highs and got us out of our lowest lows. In the pack were Twix bars, a nice treat from the usual boring tasteless food. I was chosen to open the pack, maybe I was seen as some sort of leader. I had navigated the group to the top and kept us going, I also tried to make friends with everyone, I guess I am some sort of leader, but not the leader.</p>

<p>Day six we hiked seven miles on a ridge and then traversed down to a very rainy, buggy campsite. During this, Justin kept becoming closer to people. He and I began to talk and I learned that he was a very funny kid. There are not and definite roles between anyone, everyone makes jokes, and most kids motivate, and there are no real leaders.</p>

<p>Day seven we hiked to an untouched campsite. We were the first ones to ever camp there. I began to think about growing closer to Daryl. I knew that we had to spend six or seven hours together in the airport, and I did not want that to be annoying. The next day was our solos, So I waited until after then to make an impact on Daryl.</p>

<p>Day eight we waited all day until we could go to our solo sights. All day the entire group just talked, that is all we could do. We grew tight. Daryl also became more open and bonded with the group. We all played some games out instructors told us about, and after dinner was time for solos. We were to be silent until we were brought back. The silence began and ended with a quote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Solitude is a silent storm that breaks down all our dead branches. <br />Yet, it sends out living roots deeper into the living hear of the living earth.<br />Man struggles to find life outside himself, unaware that the life he is seeking is within him.<br />Nature reaches out to us with welcome arms and bids us enjoy her beauty; but we dread her silence and rush into the crowded cities, there to huddle like sheep fleeing from the ferocious wolf.<br /><br />– <b>K. Gibran</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this poem was read to us before our solos, it did not have much meaning to me. I looked at it another poem. Now that look back at it, and see what it is saying, I can see what it really means. This poem is saying that silence destroys, and you do not know what to do. Knowing there are people you can talk to, but at this time, you cannot, and it makes you feel alone. As you pass this stage, the silence makes you appreciate things, such as silence. When searching for something to help you, you over look that what you need comes from within. And there sits nature. Something that is so peaceful, and so quiet. Just there for us to see and appreciate, yet all we want to do is get back to what we feel is reality. Being in a crowded city, seeing all the people and feeling safe. When in-fact, being alone in silence is the safest, and most beautiful thing there is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t interest me what you do for a living.<br />I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your hearts longing.<br />It doesn’t interest me how old you are.<br />I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive.<br />It doesn’t interest me what planets are squaring your moon.<br />I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life’s betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain. I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide or fade it or fix it. I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own: if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, be realistic, or to remember the limitations of being a human.<br />It doesn’t interest me if the story you’re telling me is true.<br />I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself, if you can be the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul. I want to know if you can be faithful and therefore be trustworthy. I want to know if you can see the beauty even when it is not pretty everyday, and if you can source your life from its presence. I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of a lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, YES!<br />It doesn’t interest me to know where you live or how much money you have.<br />I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done for the children.<br />It doesn’t interest me who you are, or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back.<br />It doesn’t interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away.<br />I want to know if you can be alone with yourself, and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.<br /><br />- <b>Oriah Mountain Dreamer, Indian Elder. The Invitation.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me the Invitation is saying, it does not matter how you feel because you have to be able to risk everything for what you believe in . You have to do what you feel is right in your heart, and what you feel you need to do. It does not matter what you are doing with your life; the only thing that matters is if you are fulfilling your dreams. No matter how old you are, you must go after what you want and love. Have you actually loved something so much before, that you felt so much pain, and could hardly go on with your life? And can you deal with this pain, no matter how much it hurts, just as you can accept what is good in your life. If you do not speak the truth to others, then are you really being true to yourself, or are you cheating yourself. You have to be able to tell yourself, even if you failed, that you did everything you could, and that you strive for as much as you could. Setting aside things that are important to you, for something that is important for someone else, is what should be seen. And can you deal with being alone, not having anyone or anything to see or do. Can you sit there and see what is wrong with your personality, see how you can make yourself a better person.</p>

<p>This it was The Invitation is saying to me. And this poem reflects how I now feel. Being on a 42 hour solo changes you as a person. It makes you view your life in a different aspect.</p>

<h3 id="is-maslows-hierarchy-reached-during-the-trip">Is Maslow’s Hierarchy reached During the Trip?</h3>

<p>For Maslow’s Hierarchy to be completed, the lowest step has to be accomplished before the step on top can be reached. You must satisfy your physical needs; food, shelter, and sex; safety and security; social and belonging; esteem and ego; and finally you become self-actualized.</p>

<p>I went to Washington in a good physical condition, and as the two weeks progressed, I became more physically fit. Step one has been achieved. Food and shelter was provided, there was enough food to satisfy each person and the shelter helped with the elements. Step two was also achieved. Having shelter and being with two very experienced mountaineers, I personally felt safe and secure. There were no worries about being attacked by animals, and even if this had happened, John and Eric were certified for any possible injuries, Step three was achieved. During the beginning of the trip, I did not feel I belonged socially, it was not for a few days that I felt I was part of the group. Creating a relationship with someone takes more than a few minutes, and a whole group takes even longer, so this was hard to achieve. I became friends with most of the group. Step four was achieved as well. My esteem and ego were achieved through goals I set for myself as well as befriending people in the group. I feel that with what we were given on this trip, the supplies, people, and surroundings, that I was self-actualized, but only on the trip, because I fulfilled all the steps, in my life, I have not yet been self-actualized.</p>

<h3 id="bonds-between-people">Bonds Between People</h3>

<p>When individuals are put together in an environment, under a certain cause, they create relationships through common bonds. Bonds are created through similarities that people have. A bond is something that connects two or more separate things, in this case two or more people. Along with similarities, bonds are created through asking questions and learning about another person. On a leadership program trip, such as Outward Bound, the bonds that are formed are formed under circumstances that are out of your control.</p>

<p>Outward Bound was first established in Great Britain during 1941. It is the oldest, largest and most recognized leadership program in the world. The name Outward Bound comes from the nautical term that describes the moment a ship leaves the harbor. During WWII, German U-boats were sinking British ships, and many sailors died as they waited to be rescued from the frigid waters. Sir Lawrence Holt, owner of the Blue Funnel shipping line in Great Britain, called upon an educator, Kurt Hahn, to help him uncover the answer to the question: Why were the older, more seasoned sailors surviving at a rate much higher than the younger and presumably more fit sailors? (Outward, 1)</p>

<p>Hahn identified the problem as a lack of confidence rather than any shortage of skill or equipment. He recognized that the younger sailors had not yet developed an understanding of their own physical, emotional and psychological resources. The older men were able to draw on their life experiences and inner resources to survive the hardships presented to them. Hahn then opened the first school, and taught young men the mental and physical strengths that they would need to survive. The school was an immediate success. (Outward, 1)</p>

<p>Outward Bound is a school that teaches you how to be a leader and find your inner-self. Course number PNC113 was in the North Cascades Mountains, of Washington State. It is a mountaineering course, which teaches students the skills needed to go cross-country hiking and rock climbing.</p>

<p>Cross-country hiking is hiking through unknown terrain and picking your route by the looks of the path. Cross-country hiking depends on skill and experience, because there are many routes to take. Rock climbing is an activity that requires a lot of practice. When you are rock climbing, you need to know how to belay and climb with your arms, not with your legs. Most people find it easier to climb with their legs, however it is much easier to keep yourself balanced with your legs and pull with your arms. Rock climbing also includes choosing a route. The choice depends on the climbers’ skill level.</p>

<p>There were ten students on course PNC113 and two instructors. The students were Daryl, John W., John A., Justin, Clint, Julian, Zach, Andrew, Neal, and Nicolas. The instructor’s names were John and Eric.</p>

<p>The students were from different areas around the United States. Daryl was from Connecticut; John W. was from Maine; John A. was from California; Justin was from Ohio; Clint and Julian were from Washington; Zach and Neal were from Oregon; Andrew was from Montana; and Nicolas was from New Jersey.</p>

<p>In unfamiliar surroundings and when with complete strangers, a person tends to feel alone. Although everyone is in the same situation, it is still hard to make the first move. It is helpful to have others around that know what they are doing. They help you create relationships, friendships, and bonds. The instructors encouraged this by creating games to learn names, and become acquainted with the other students.</p>

<p>One game was a circle of people with one person in the middle. Everyone would say their name once and then the person in the circle would have to say the name of whoever was pointed at by John or Eric. Another game involved statements. The group would stand in a circle and each person would make a statement, if you agreed with that statement you would take a step into the middle. If you would rather not voice you opinion you step backwards in from the circle. If you did not agree with the statement, you would stay where you were. These games brought the group together, and made it easier to interact with the other people.</p>

<p>When you are spending every waking moment with the same people everyday, you will obviously speak to one another through necessity because of the experiences in which you are involved. This makes it easier to create bonds and find similar interests, which is essential when forming new friendships. There are many similarities between people that are around the same age and going through common experiences in their lives.</p>

<p>Surprisingly there were only a few strong relationships that occurred on the Outward Bound trip PNC113 in Washington on July 22. One very strong relationship was between Julian, John W., and Nicolas. These three boys had a lot in common, they all liked similar types of music, they were interested in sports, and they came from a cultured background. During most of the trip, they were always together, they led the group, and pushed each other to get through obstacles that were challenging for them. Having common interests sparked the friendship but being there for one another formed a strong bond between the three boys.</p>

<p>Another relationship created was between Julian and Justin. They formed a friendship through a common interest that they both had, and from there it grew. They were both comedians and enjoyed conversing about topics that others in the group did not have much knowledge about.</p>

<p>While being in the exact situation with nine other people for two weeks, you find many common traits between each other, such as your love for the same kind of music, taste in movie genre’s, favorite television shows, etc. For example, everyone on the Outward Bound course #PNC113, was interested in the television show The Simpson’s. Through this television show, everyone could relate. Even when there are not many similarities, you can still connect with a person because you are going through the same experience as them, therefor, it is not possible in the end to not have something in common with another person.</p>

<p>When people are put in a situation where they are forced to work together, they find bonds between them and create relationships. When people are put into similar situations, they find more in common and it becomes more natural to connect with each other. The bonds formed between the boys began with common interests and extended into trying to reach a common goal. Without these components trust and friendships would not have formed.</p>
